### Hi ðŸ‘‹

### Fun Fact

I don't use github for any of my serious projects, I use gitlab and its private repositories.

### Frameworks

- Creator of a WordPress Framework + all its libraries + a CLI for it written in NodeJS
- Creator of a React-Native Framework + all its libraries + a CLI for it written in NodeJS

### Libraries

Each of my frameworks contain 10+ libraries which I have created myself, most of these are private here are a few (mostly fork) ones that are not

- https://github.com/Stevemoretz/async-react-php
- https://github.com/Stevemoretz/reconnecting-websocket

The rest of my libraries contain

- a Really cool library with drivers (plugins) support for Laravel built for sending any kind of data from server -> client. eg : SMS, Email, Websocket, Push Notification.
- Multilingual Features, styling and a lot of ready-to-use components for React Native
- Opcache CLI support

and many more.
